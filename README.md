. You Teach It 📚
You simply drag and drop your company manuals, FAQs, or help guides into a Google Drive folder. The AI automatically reads and "memorizes" everything in them instantly.

2. It Watches Your Email 👀
The assistant constantly detects new emails in your inbox. It is smart enough to ignore spam or newsletters and focus only on customer questions.

3. It Answers for You 💬
When a customer asks a question:

If the answer is in your files: The AI writes a polite, professional reply with the exact answer and sends it immediately.
If it doesn't know: It won't guess. It simply tells the customer, "I couldn't find that info, let me connect you with a human expert."
